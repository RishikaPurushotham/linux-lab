Experiment 8: Shell Programming
* * *

Aim:
To extend shell programming concepts by using conditional statements, advanced scripting
constructs, and command-line arguments.
To practice writing scripts that perform decision-making and parameter handling.
* * *
Requirements
A Linux system with bash shell.
Text editor and permission to create/execute shell scripts.
* * *
Theory
Conditional execution in shell scripts allows branching logic using if , elif , else , and case
statements. Scripts can accept command-line arguments using $1 , $2 , … and $@ for all arguments.Control flow constructs combined with user input and arguments allow dynamic and reusable scripts.

Procedure & Observations
Exercise 1: Using if-else
Task Statement:
Write a script to check whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.
Explanation:

We used an if-elif-else construct to compare the number against 0.

Command(s):


#!/bin/bash
num=$1
if [ $num -gt 0 ]; then
echo "$num is positive"
elif [ $num -lt 0 ]; then
echo "$num is negative"
else
echo "$num is zero"
fi

Exercise 2: Using case
Task Statement:
Write a script that takes a character as input and classifies it as vowel, consonant, digit, or special
character.
Explanation:
The case statement provides pattern matching for multiple options.
Command(s):
#!/bin/bash
ch=$1
case $ch in
[aeiouAEIOU]) echo "$ch is a vowel" ;
echo "$ch is a consonant" ;
[0-9]) echo "$ch is a digit" ;
*) echo "$ch is a special character" ;
esac

Exercise 3: Command-line arguments
Task Statement:
Write a script that accepts filename(s) as arguments and prints the number of lines in each file.
Explanation:
Command-line arguments are accessed using $@ . Looping through each argument allows file-wise
operations.

Command(s):
#!/bin/bash
for file in "$@"; do
if [ -f "$file" ]; then
echo "$file: $(wc -l < "$file") lines"
else
echo "$file not found"
fi
done

Output:

Exercise 4: Nested conditionals
Task Statement:
Write a script to check if a year is a leap year.
Explanation:
A leap year is divisible by 4, but if divisible by 100 it must also be divisible by 400.
Command(s):
#!/bin/bash
year=$1
if (( year % 400 == 0 )); then
echo "$year is a leap year"
elif (( year % 100 == 0 )); then
echo "$year is not a leap year"
elif (( year % 4 == 0 )); then
echo "$year is a leap year"
else
echo "$year is not a leap year"
fi

**Result**
Implemented conditional statements ( if-else , case ) in shell scripts.
Practiced handling command-line arguments and nested conditions.
Wrote reusable and flexible shell scripts.

**Challenges Faced & Learning Outcomes**

Challenge 1: Forgetting to quote variables in conditions — resolved by using "$var" to avoid word
splitting.
Challenge 2: Pattern matching in case — practiced with multiple examples

**Learning:**

Learned practical use of branching and decision-making in shell scripting.
Understood command-line argument handling for automation.

**Conclusion**
This experiment extended shell programming by introducing decision-making and parameter handling.
The scripts demonstrate the flexibility of shell programming for different use cases.
